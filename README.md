# Personalizing-3DIVP-TBAD
This code is to used to personalize synthetic 3D IVPs for computational studies in TBAD. .<br>
Workflow for applying synthetic IVPs:

## Seclet a waveform  
Select an appraporiate inlet flow waveform based on stoke volume (SV) and systole-to-disatole ratio (SDR).

## Select a syntheic profile
8 different synthetic profiles are provided in this repo. Pick 1 for mapping.
